# Blaock

Simple block-stacking game similar to Tetris built with HTML and JavaScript.

Open `index.html` in your browser and press **Start** to begin. Use the on-screen
buttons or arrow keys to move and rotate pieces. On mobile, tap the empty left,
right or bottom area around the board to move pieces and tap the board itself to
rotate. Toggle sound with the speaker button.

Clear the line goals shown for each level to progress. Levels 1â€“10 require 5
to 50 lines respectively and the game speeds up as you advance.
